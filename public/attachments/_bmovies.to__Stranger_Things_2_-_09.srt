00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:10,409
Eleven.

2
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:12,453
Mike.

3
00:00:16,457 --> 00:00:17,625
Is that...

4
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:24,256
I never gave up on you.

5
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:28,300
I called you every
night. Every night for...

6
00:00:28,302 --> 00:00:29,867
353 days.

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,848
I heard.

8
00:00:33,557 --> 00:00:35,391
Why didn't you tell me you were there?

9
00:00:35,393 --> 00:00:37,753
- That you were okay?
- Because I wouldn't let her.

10
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:43,481
- The hell is this? Where you been?
- Where have you been?

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,880
You've been hiding her.

12
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:50,989
- You've been hiding her this whole time!
- Hey!

13
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:52,493
Let's talk.

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,495
Alone.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,093
- Protecting her! Protecting her?
- Listen. Listen to me.

16
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,629
The more people know about
her, the more danger she's in.

17
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,923
And the more danger you
and your family are in...

18
00:01:07,925 --> 00:01:09,299
So I should be thanking you?

19
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:12,970
I'm not asking you to thank me!
I'm asking you to try to understand.

20
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,388
I don't! I don't understand!

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,307
That's fine. That's fine!
Just do not blame her!

22
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:19,268
All right? She's upset enough as it is.

23
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,728
I don't blame her! I
blame you! I blame you!

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:24,022
That's okay, kid. That's okay.

25
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:26,233
No! Nothing about this is okay!

26
00:01:26,235 --> 00:01:28,861
- Nothing about this is okay!
- Oh, jeez...

27
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:30,437
You're a stupid, disgusting,

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,573
- lying piece of shit!
- Okay. All right! Stop it.

29
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:34,575
- Liar! Liar! Liar!
- Stop it. It's okay.

30
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:37,163
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Liar! Liar!

31
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,920
You're okay, kid. You're okay.

32
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,216
I'm sorry, kid.

33
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,761
- We missed you.
- I missed you, too.

34
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:56,849
We talked about you
pretty much every day.

35
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:03,395
Teeth.

36
00:02:03,397 --> 00:02:05,065
- What?
- You have teeth.

37
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:09,985
Oh. You like these pearls?

38
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:11,280
Eleven?

39
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:16,492
Hey. Um, I'm Max.

40
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:17,828
I've heard a lot about you.

41
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,169
Hey. Hey, sweetheart.

42
00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:28,422
Hey.

43
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:31,926
Can I see him?

44
00:02:46,315 --> 00:02:48,400
He's not doing well.

45
00:02:51,487 --> 00:02:52,863
I know.

46
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,242
I saw.

47
00:02:57,117 --> 00:02:58,786
What else did you see?

48
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:13,842
You opened this gate before, right?

49
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:18,013
Yes.

50
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:24,311
Do you think if we got you back
there, that you could close it?

51

_

53
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:18,842
Ted! Would you please get that?

54
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:30,394
Ted!

55
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,467
Hold on, please.

56
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:46,370
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

57
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:50,163
I, uh, didn't realize
Nancy had a sister.

58
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,252
What's so funny?

59
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,002
I'm Nancy's mother.

60
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,379
- No.
- Yes.

61
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:59,214
Mrs. Wheeler.

62
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:01,883
Um, I'm sorry, and you are?

63
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:04,138
Billy. Billy Hargrove.

64
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:07,472
You must be here for Nancy.

65
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:10,434
Nancy? No, no, no. Not my type. Uh...

66
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:14,563
No, actually, I am looking
for my little sister Max.

67
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,273
Goes by Maxine.

68
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,401
She's been missing all day,
and, uh, to be honest with you,

69
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:22,257
- I've been worried sick, you know, so...
- Oh.

70
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,306
I thought she was at Lucas', but Mrs.
Sinclair said your house is the...

71
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,289
the designated hangout, so, you know...

72
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,001
Here I am.

73
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:39,581
Their driveway is pretty
dark this time of night.

74
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:41,967
So drive slowly.

75
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:45,260
Always.

76
00:06:45,262 --> 00:06:47,718
And when you see Mike, tell
him to come home already, okay?

77
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,515
You're a real lifesaver, you know that?

78
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:52,934
Anytime.

79
00:06:52,936 --> 00:06:55,063
I'll see you later.

80
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,738
Hmm.

81
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:22,923
It's not like it was before. It's grown.

82
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:26,384
A lot. And, I mean, that's
considering we can get in there.

83
00:07:26,386 --> 00:07:28,220
The place is crawling with those dogs.

84
00:07:28,222 --> 00:07:29,288
Demo-dogs.

85
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:33,975
- I'm sorry, what?
- I said, uh, Demo-dogs.

86
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:35,416
Like Demogorgon and dogs.

87
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,419
You put them together,
it sounds pretty badass...

88
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:38,897
How is this important right now?

89
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,315
It's not. I'm sorry.

90
00:07:40,317 --> 00:07:41,416
I can do it.

91
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,443
You're not hearing me.

92
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,862
I'm hearing you. I can do it.

93
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:48,323
Even if El can, there's
still another problem.

94
00:07:48,325 --> 00:07:51,243
- If the brain dies, the body dies.
- I thought that was the whole point.

95
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:53,995
It is, but if we're
really right about this...

96
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:57,123
I mean, if El closes the gate and
kills the mind flayer's army...

97
00:07:57,125 --> 00:07:58,625
Will's a part of that army.

98
00:07:58,627 --> 00:08:00,212
Closing the gate will kill him.

99
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:16,236
- He likes it cold.
- What?

100
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,147
It's what Will kept saying to me.

101
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,650
He likes it cold.

102
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,986
We keep giving it what it wants.

103
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:30,782
If this is a virus, and
Will's the host, then...

104
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:32,786
Then we need to make
the host uninhabitable.

105
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,453
So if he likes it cold...

106
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:36,913
We need to burn it out of him.

107
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:39,124
We have to do it somewhere
he doesn't know this time.

108
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:40,460
Yeah, somewhere far away.

109
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,132
Take Denfield, then you'll
see a large oak tree.

110
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:50,594
You're gonna swing a right.
That road is gonna dead-end.

111
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,013
And it's about a
five-minute walk from there.

112
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:56,892
Okay. Denfield to oak
tree. Swing a right.

113
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:59,144
That's it. But it's channel ten, right?

114
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:00,896
It's channel ten. Listen...

115
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:03,650
You let me know when
that thing is out of him.

116
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,287
You should go with him.

117
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,999
- What?
- With Jonathan.

118
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,836
No, I'm... I'm not
just gonna leave Mike.

119
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,255
No one's leaving anyone.

120
00:09:27,257 --> 00:09:31,970
I may be a pretty
shitty boyfriend, but...

121
00:09:34,014 --> 00:09:36,683
turns out I'm actually a
pretty damn good babysitter.

122
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,691
Steve...

123
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:47,945
It's okay, Nance.

124
00:09:50,002 --> 00:09:51,156
It's okay.

125
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:53,734
I...

126
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:08,674
Just be careful, okay?
I can't lose you again.

127
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,468
You won't lose me.

128
00:10:12,302 --> 00:10:13,549
Do you promise?

129
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:15,555
Promise.

130
00:10:20,143 --> 00:10:23,105
El... Come on, let's go. It's time.

131
00:10:27,109 --> 00:10:28,228
Okay.

132
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,704
So, what, we're just not
gonna talk about it, huh?

133
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:23,747
About what?

134
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,582
Oh, I don't know. I'm
just curious, you know,

135
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:28,494
why all of a sudden you look
like some kind of MTV punk.

136
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:34,634
I'm not mad, kid. I just want
to know where you've been.

137
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,512
That's all.

138
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,933
To see Mama.

139
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:46,062
Okay.

140
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,648
- How'd you get there?
- A truck.

141
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,275
A truck?

142
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,320
A big truck.

143
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:56,946
A big truck? Whose truck was it?

144
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:58,963
- A man's.
- A man's?

145
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:00,327
A nice man.

146
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:05,705
Okay. So let me just get
this straight in my head.

147
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:07,999
So a nice man in a big truck,

148
00:12:08,001 --> 00:12:10,126
he drove you to your
mama's, and then what?

149
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:13,252
Your Aunt Becky gave you
those clothes and that makeup?

150
00:12:13,255 --> 00:12:14,341
I...

151
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:17,511
I shouldn't have left.

152
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:21,905
Mmm-mmm.

153
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:23,924
No.

154
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,604
No, this isn't on you,
kid. I should've been there.

155
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,068
I should never have lied
to you about your mom.

156
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,403
Or about when you could leave.

157
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:38,406
A lot of things I shouldn't have done.

158
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,245
Sometimes I feel like I'm...

159
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,709
Like I'm just some kind
of black hole or something.

160
00:12:51,711 --> 00:12:52,919
A black hole?

161
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:56,714
Yeah, it's a... You know,
it's this thing in outer space.

162
00:12:56,716 --> 00:13:00,470
It's like, it sucks everything
towards it and destroys it.

163
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:04,516
Sarah had a picture book about
outer space. She loved it.

164
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,225
Who's Sarah?

165
00:13:07,227 --> 00:13:08,228
Sarah?

166
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,109
Sarah's my girl.

167
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:18,780
She's my little girl.

168
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,284
Where is she?

169
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:26,997
Well, that's kind of the
thing, kid. She, uh...

170
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:31,001
She left us.

171
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,337
- Gone.
- Yeah.

172
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:39,175
The black hole. It got her.

173
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:44,431
And somehow...

174
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,518
I've just been scared, you know?

175
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:51,980
I've just been scared that
it would take you, too.

176
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:54,691
I think that's why I get...

177
00:13:55,942 --> 00:13:57,360
so mad.

178
00:14:00,614 --> 00:14:01,865
I'm so sorry.

179
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:04,743
For everything.

180
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:10,788
I could be so... so...

181
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,123
Stupid?

182
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,418
Yeah. Stupid.

183
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,256
Just really stupid.

184
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:29,935
I've been stupid, too.

185
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:32,685
I guess we broke our rule.

186
00:14:35,065 --> 00:14:36,940
I don't hate it, by the way.

187
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,151
This whole...

188
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,106
look.

189
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:44,366
It's kinda cool.

190
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,160
Bitchin'.

191
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,997
Okay. Sure.

192
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:58,630
Bitchin'.

193
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,325
All right.

194
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:29,744
It should fit now.

195
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,703
Is this really necessary?

196
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,872
Yes, it is, okay? This is a
ground-breaking scientific discovery.

197
00:15:34,874 --> 00:15:38,293
We can't just bury it like some
common mammal, okay? It's not a dog.

198
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:40,128
All right, all right, all right.

199
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,882
But you're explaining this
to Mrs. Byers, all right?

200
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,092
Christ. Help me out.

201
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:48,219
- What am I supposed to do?
- Get the door, man.

202
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:49,887
All right, I got the door.

203
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:52,225
- Ew. Jesus...
- God...

204
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:56,813
Phew!

205
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,490
Mike, would you just stop already?

206
00:16:09,492 --> 00:16:11,117
You weren't in there, okay, Lucas?

207
00:16:11,119 --> 00:16:13,536
That lab is swarming with
hundreds of those dogs.

208
00:16:13,538 --> 00:16:15,747
- Demo-dogs!
- The chief will take care of her.

209
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,081
Like she needs protection.

210
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,958
Listen, dude, a coach
calls a play in a game,

211
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,626
bottom line, you execute it. All right?

212
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:22,920
Okay, first of all, this
isn't some stupid sports game.

213
00:16:22,922 --> 00:16:25,590
And second, we're not even in
the game. We're on the bench.

214
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:27,969
So my point is...

215
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:33,765
Right, yeah, we're on the bench,
so, uh, there's nothing we can do.

216
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:36,059
That's not entirely true.

217
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:39,110
I mean, these Demo-dogs,
they have a hive mind.

218
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,454
When they ran away from the
bus, they were called away.

219
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:44,317
- If we get their attention...
- Maybe we can draw them from the lab.

220
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,777
Clear a path to the gate.

221
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,195
Yeah, and then we all die.

222
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:48,279
That's one point of view.

223
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:50,406
No, that's not a point of
view, man. That's a fact.

224
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:51,743
I got it!

225
00:16:52,452 --> 00:16:56,162
This is where the chief dug his hole.
This is our way into the tunnel. So...

226
00:16:56,164 --> 00:16:58,456
Here, right here. This is like a hub.

227
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:00,416
So you got all the
tunnels feeding in here.

228
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:02,043
Maybe if we set this on fire...

229
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:02,976
Oh, yeah? That's a no.

230
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:05,469
- The mind flayer would call away his army.
- They'd all come to stop us.

231
00:17:05,471 --> 00:17:07,020
- We circle back to the exit.
- Guys.

232
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:09,092
- By the time they realize we're gone...
- El would be at the gate.

233
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,595
Hey. Hey! Hey! This is not happening.

234
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:13,679
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.

235
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:15,681
No buts. I promised I'd
keep you shitheads safe,

236
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:17,225
and that's exactly what I plan on.

237
00:17:17,227 --> 00:17:19,185
We're staying here. On the bench.

238
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:21,479
And we're waiting for the
starting team to do their job.

239
00:17:21,481 --> 00:17:22,563
Does everybody understand?

240
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:24,315
This isn't a stupid sports game.

241
00:17:24,317 --> 00:17:26,319
I said does everybody understand that?

242
00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:28,780
I need a yes.

243
00:17:37,163 --> 00:17:38,413
It's my brother.

244
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:41,835
He can't know I'm here.
He'll kill me. He'll kill us.

245
00:17:57,175 --> 00:18:00,093
Am I dreaming, or is
that you, Harrington?

246
00:18:00,103 --> 00:18:01,729
Yeah, it's me. Don't cream your pants.

247
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:05,316
What are you doing here, amigo?

248
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:07,861
I could ask you the same thing.

249
00:18:08,569 --> 00:18:09,737
Amigo.

250
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,365
Looking for my stepsister. A
little birdie told me she was here.

251
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,117
Huh, that's weird. I don't know her.

252
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:18,995
Small? Redhead? Bit of a bitch.

253
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,373
Doesn't ring a bell. Sorry, buddy.

254
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:25,877
You know, I don't know, this...

255
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:28,506
This whole situation,
Harrington, I don't know.

256
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:30,590
It's giving me the heebie-jeebies.

257
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:31,801
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

258
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:36,471
My 13-year-old sister
goes missing all day.

259
00:18:36,473 --> 00:18:40,268
And then I find her with
you in a stranger's house.

260
00:18:41,895 --> 00:18:43,352
And you lie to me about it.

261
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,568
Man, were you dropped too
much as a child, or what?

262
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:52,197
I don't know what you don't
understand about what I just said.

263
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,366
She's not here.

264
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:57,827
Then who is that?

265
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,829
Shit! Did he see us?

266
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:03,500
Oh, shit. Listen...

267
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,379
I told you to plant your feet.

268
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,092
Well, well, well.

269
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:17,096
Lucas Sinclair. What a surprise.

270
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:20,473
I thought I told you to
stay away from him, Max.

271
00:19:20,475 --> 00:19:22,352
- Billy, go away.
- You disobeyed me.

272
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:25,311
And you know what happens
when you disobey me.

273
00:19:25,313 --> 00:19:27,647
- Billy...
- I break things.

274
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:31,236
Billy! Stop! Billy! Stop!

275
00:19:33,321 --> 00:19:34,403
Get off of me, you...

276
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,948
Since Maxine won't listen
to me, maybe you will.

277
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,658
You stay away from her.

278
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,121
Stay away from her! You hear me?

279
00:19:42,997 --> 00:19:44,374
I said get off me!

280
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,504
So dead, Sinclair! You're dead.

281
00:19:50,797 --> 00:19:52,129
No. You are.

282
00:19:53,216 --> 00:19:54,507
Steve!

283
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,429
Looks like you got some
fire in you after all, huh?

284
00:20:00,431 --> 00:20:02,348
I've been waiting to
meet this King Steve

285
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,562
everybody's been
telling me so much about.

286
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:07,438
Get out.

287
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,570
- Yes! Kick his ass, Steve!
- Get him!

288
00:20:15,572 --> 00:20:17,446
Murder the son of a bitch!

289
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:19,490
- Now! Now!
- Get that shithead!

290
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:21,492
Kill the son of a bitch!

291
00:20:21,494 --> 00:20:23,077
- Steve!
- Billy!

292
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,187
Holy shit!

293
00:20:24,872 --> 00:20:26,874
Shit!

294
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:35,006
No one tells me what to do!

295
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:36,382
Whoo! Get up!

296
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:38,344
You're gonna kill him.

297
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,758
The hell is this?

298
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,845
You little shit, what did you do?

299
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:23,348
What did you do?

300
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:26,265
Shit.

301
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:37,568
From here on out, you leave me and
my friends alone. Do you understand?

302
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,821
Screw you.

303
00:21:42,575 --> 00:21:46,871
Say you understand! Say it! Say it!

304
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:48,871
I understand.

305
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:51,125
- What?
- I understand.

306
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,224
Let's get out of here.

307
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:42,093
It's actually kinda nice.

308
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:50,977
We'll do it here.

309
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,040
Are you sure this is a good idea?

310
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,918
This thing has had Will long enough.

311
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:19,422
Let's kill the son of a bitch.

312
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:04,926
Papa!

313
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:16,810
All right. You let me do the
heavy lifting up front, all right?

314
00:24:16,812 --> 00:24:18,898
You save your strength till we're below.

315
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,360
You okay?

316
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:56,269
Nancy?

317
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:02,316
No, don't touch it.

318
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,612
Hey, buddy...

319
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,113
It's okay. You put up a good fight.

320
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,948
He kicked your ass,
but you put up a fight.

321
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,241
You're okay.

322
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:14,994
Okay, you're gonna keep
straight for a half a mile,

323
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:16,914
then make a left on Mount Sinai.

324
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,709
What's going on?

325
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:22,209
Oh, my God!

326
00:25:22,211 --> 00:25:23,627
Just relax. She's driven before.

327
00:25:23,629 --> 00:25:25,212
- Yeah, in a parking lot.
- That counts.

328
00:25:25,214 --> 00:25:26,630
They were gonna leave you behind.

329
00:25:26,632 --> 00:25:27,840
Oh, my God.

330
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:29,550
I promised that you'd be cool, okay?

331
00:25:29,552 --> 00:25:32,177
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

332
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:37,182
Oh, my God. No! Whoa!
Stop the car. Slow down.

333
00:25:37,184 --> 00:25:39,184
- I told you he'd freak out.
- Stop the car!

334
00:25:39,186 --> 00:25:41,770
Everybody shut up! I'm trying to focus!

335
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:43,480
Oh, wait, that's Mount
Sinai. Make a left.

336
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:44,982
- What?
- Make a left.

337
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:05,753
What's happening?

338
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:07,588
It hurts.

339
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:13,763
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

340
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,058
Let me go! Let me go! It hurts!

341
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,230
It hurts! Let me go!
Let me go! It hurts!

342
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:27,026
- Mom.
- No!

343
00:26:32,865 --> 00:26:35,868
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

344
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:45,209
Hello!

345
00:26:45,211 --> 00:26:47,252
- Whoa!
- Incredible.

346
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:49,256
I told you. Zoomer.

347
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,474
Guys.

348
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:03,896
Oh, no. Guys.

349
00:27:05,314 --> 00:27:07,606
Hey, where do you think you're going?

350
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:10,150
What are you, deaf? Hello?

351
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:13,112
We are not going down there
right now. I made myself clear.

352
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,948
Hey, there's no chance we're
going to that hole, all right?

353
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,242
This ends right now!

354
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:20,202
Steve, you're upset, I get it.

355
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:23,914
But the bottom line is, a party
member requires assistance,

356
00:27:23,916 --> 00:27:26,875
and it is our duty to
provide that assistance.

357
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:29,767
Now, I know you promised Nance
that you would keep us safe.

358
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,361
So, keep us safe.

359
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:42,476
Holy shit.

360
00:27:46,272 --> 00:27:48,147
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's this way.

361
00:27:48,149 --> 00:27:50,315
You're pretty sure, or you're certain?

362
00:27:50,317 --> 00:27:53,277
I'm 100% sure. Just
follow me and you'll know.

363
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,113
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey,
hey, hey. I don't think so.

364
00:27:56,115 --> 00:27:57,030
What?

365
00:27:57,032 --> 00:28:01,368
Any of you little shits die down here,
I'm getting the blame. Got it, dipshit?

366
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,540
From here on out, I'm leading
the way. Come on, let's go.

367
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,251
Come on.

368
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,712
Hey, a little hustle.

369
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:35,488
Stay here.

370
00:28:43,454 --> 00:28:44,747
Oh, shit.

371
00:28:53,089 --> 00:28:54,296
Hey, Doc.

372
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:58,886
Those suckers got you pretty good, huh?

373
00:28:59,553 --> 00:29:00,883
It's okay, don't talk.

374
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:04,809
Don't talk. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

375
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:12,022
Oh, yeah, I've been meaning to tell you.

376
00:29:12,024 --> 00:29:16,195
This is Eleven. Eleven, Doc
Owens. Doc Owens, Eleven.

377
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:20,906
She's been staying
with me for about a year

378
00:29:20,908 --> 00:29:23,285
and she's about to save our asses.

379
00:29:24,578 --> 00:29:26,203
Maybe when this is all said and done,

380
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:28,749
maybe you could help
her out, too, you know?

381
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,336
Maybe you could help her
lead, like, a normal life.

382
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,840
One where she's not
poked and prodded and...

383
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,801
treated like some kind
of lab rat, you know?

384
00:29:39,426 --> 00:29:40,717
I don't know, just a thought.

385
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:45,266
But, uh... think about it.

386
00:29:52,064 --> 00:29:53,313
Don't go anywhere.

387
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,331
God.

388
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:13,292
What is this place?

389
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:15,588
Guys, come on. Keep moving.

390
00:30:22,595 --> 00:30:23,804
What the hell?

391
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:30,060
Shit!

392
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,397
- Help! Help! Help!
- Dustin.

393
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,565
Shit!

394
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,358
- Dustin!
- Dustin!

395
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,568
What happened?

396
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,905
It's in my mouth! Some
got on my mouth! Shit!

397
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:54,791
I'm okay.

398
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:57,294
- You serious?
- Very funny, man.

399
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:59,298
- Nice. Very nice.
- Jesus, what an idiot.

400
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,051
Hang on. Wait, wait.

401
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:12,436
All right, Wheeler.

402
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:15,397
I think we found your hub.

403
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:29,703
Drench it.

404
00:31:52,268 --> 00:31:56,186
It's not working. It's not working.
Mom, are you listening to me?

405
00:31:56,188 --> 00:31:58,146
- Just wait!
- How much longer?

406
00:31:58,148 --> 00:31:59,273
Look... look at him!

407
00:31:59,275 --> 00:32:00,816
- Jonathan, wait!
- You're killing him!

408
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,111
Just wait!

409
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:04,595
- No!
- No, leave it!

410
00:32:04,598 --> 00:32:05,904
- You're killing him!
- Leave it!

411
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:09,717
Wait, Jonathan, Jonathan!
His neck! His neck!

412
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:20,921
No, no, no, no.

413
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:47,406
Stay here.

414
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:40,707
- You ready?
- Yeah.

415
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:42,002
- Ready.
- Ready.

416
00:33:43,837 --> 00:33:45,005
Light her up.

417
00:33:46,131 --> 00:33:49,176
I am in such deep shit.

418
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:11,990
All right.

419
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,669
Get the hell out of my son!

420
00:34:40,477 --> 00:34:42,896
Go, go, go!

421
00:34:49,736 --> 00:34:50,944
Let's go, let's go!

422
00:34:50,946 --> 00:34:52,154
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

423
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,522
Will, baby.

424
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,565
Will. Will.

425
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,443
- Please, Will. Will.
- Come on, buddy.

426
00:35:31,445 --> 00:35:33,236
- Please. Can you hear me?
- Come on.

427
00:35:33,238 --> 00:35:35,157
- Come on.
- Please. Will.

428
00:35:40,162 --> 00:35:41,369
Mom?

429
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:44,500
Oh, honey. Oh, God.

430
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,355
Chief, are you there?
Chief, do you copy?

431
00:36:08,357 --> 00:36:09,522
Yeah, I copy.

432
00:36:09,525 --> 00:36:11,903
Close it.

433
00:36:50,065 --> 00:36:52,442
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

434
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:57,197
Hey, this way!

435
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:04,496
Help! Help! Help! Help!

436
00:37:56,506 --> 00:37:58,632
Help! Help!

437
00:37:58,634 --> 00:38:00,717
- Hold on!
- Steve, pull him out.

438
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:02,344
Everybody back! Back!

439
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:10,018
- You good?
- You okay?

440
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,272
Guys, we gotta go!

441
00:38:17,861 --> 00:38:19,029
Dart.

442
00:38:22,824 --> 00:38:23,782
Shh. Stop.

443
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:26,244
- Dustin, get back.
- Trust me, please.

444
00:38:30,198 --> 00:38:35,451
Hey. It's me, it's me. It's
just your friend, it's Dustin.

445
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:37,829
It's Dustin, all right?

446
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:39,167
You remember me?

447
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,095
Will you let us pass?

448
00:38:44,471 --> 00:38:49,724
Okay, okay, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry about the storm cellar.

449
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:51,770
That was a pretty douchey thing to do.

450
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:55,586
You hungry? Yeah?

451
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:57,065
- He's insane.
- Don't.

452
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:57,982
Shut up.

453
00:38:57,984 --> 00:39:02,737
I've got our favorite. See? Nougat.

454
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:10,286
Look at that. Yummy. Here, all right?

455
00:39:10,288 --> 00:39:13,873
Eat up, buddy. Come on. Come on.

456
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:14,960
Let's go.

457
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,047
There's plenty. I've got more.

458
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:34,563
Goodbye, buddy.

459
00:39:35,689 --> 00:39:36,648
Let's go, let's go!

460
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,710
I want you to find
something from your past,

461
00:39:58,712 --> 00:40:00,218
something that angers you.

462
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:01,431
Now channel it.

463
00:40:02,488 --> 00:40:03,907
Papa!

464
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:20,484
Jesus!

465
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:23,860
What was that?

466
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,406
They're coming.

467
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:29,574
Run! Run!

468
00:40:29,576 --> 00:40:30,533
Let's go! Let's go!

469
00:40:30,535 --> 00:40:32,287
Come on, Mike! Move, Mike!

470
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:35,646
- There, there!
- Come on! Let's go.

471
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:38,458
Go, go, go! Let's go! Come on! Come on!

472
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,542
Come on!

473
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:41,252
Come on, hurry up! Come on!

474
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:46,216
Come on, come on, come on!

475
00:40:46,218 --> 00:40:47,886
Lucas, come on. Reach for my hand.

476
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:51,971
Come on. Pull him.

477
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:54,599
Oh, shit.

478
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:55,644
Here.

479
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:01,107
Dustin! Come on!

480
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:03,691
No!

481
00:41:10,158 --> 00:41:11,284
This is...

482
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:18,875
Eleven.

483
00:41:49,447 --> 00:41:50,615
Oh, shit!

484
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:15,265
You have a wound, Eleven.

485
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:18,143
A terrible wound.

486
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,313
The gate, I opened it.

487
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,317
-  And it's festering.
- I'm the monster.

488
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:27,235
And it will grow.

489
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:32,405
Spread.

490
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:33,615
Papa!

491
00:42:36,411 --> 00:42:39,789
And eventually, it will kill you.

492
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:43,251
Jane!

493
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:08,086
You did good, kid.

494
00:44:09,796 --> 00:44:11,172
You did so good.

495
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:06,810
Since the release of
the incendiary tape,

496
00:45:06,813 --> 00:45:09,061
the once quiet town of Hawkins, Indiana,

497
00:45:09,063 --> 00:45:11,856
has spent time in a
place it never expected.

498
00:45:11,858 --> 00:45:13,316
The national spotlight.

499
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:16,930
Under mounting pressure,
several high-ranking members

500
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:18,610
from the U.S. Department of Energy

501
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:22,173
have admitted involvement
in the death and cover-up

502
00:45:22,176 --> 00:45:25,827
of Hawkins resident Barbara
Holland who died due to exposure

503
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,581
to an experimental chemical asphyxiant,

504
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:31,000
which had leaked from
the grounds of the lab.

505
00:45:31,002 --> 00:45:34,879
We sent our own April Kline to
Hawkins to speak to residents,

506
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:38,758
residents who told us they
thought they lived in a safe town.

507
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,597
The kind of town where, they
say, nothing ever happens.

508
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:56,202
Chief-o.

509
00:45:56,205 --> 00:45:58,820
- How's the leg?
- Better.

510
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:00,919
Pretty sure my football career is over.

511
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:03,950
Want some? No way I'm gonna finish it.

512
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:05,993
No. I'm, uh... on a diet.

513
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:08,371
Well, you're a better man than me.

514
00:46:08,373 --> 00:46:10,959
Hey, got a little something for you.

515
00:46:21,636 --> 00:46:22,677
I thought...

516
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,097
Sometimes I impress even myself.

517
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,390
Still, I'd let things cool
off for a while, if I were you.

518
00:46:27,392 --> 00:46:29,519
How long is a while?

519
00:46:30,395 --> 00:46:31,811
Want to be safe? I give it a year.

520
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:32,814
A year?

521
00:46:38,278 --> 00:46:39,360
What about one night out?

522
00:46:39,362 --> 00:46:40,486
One night?

523
00:46:40,488 --> 00:46:42,864
Yeah. How risky would that be?

524
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:44,659
What's so important about one night?

525
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,068
Yeah, you got it. See?

526
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,447
Mom!

527
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:08,681
Wow!

528
00:47:15,648 --> 00:47:17,565
Do you always have to
be filming everything?

529
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:20,067
No, no. Just the good stuff.

530
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:22,278
Are you sure people
still dance like this?

531
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,322
Yeah. It's just what's happening.

532
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:25,573
Is it what's happening?

533
00:47:25,575 --> 00:47:27,493
Yeah, yeah, it's what's happening.

534
00:47:32,957 --> 00:47:33,873
Oh, wait.

535
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:35,166
All right, that's enough.

536
00:47:35,168 --> 00:47:37,627
- One more, okay? Just one more.
- Why?

537
00:47:37,629 --> 00:47:39,503
- You look so handsome.
- Mom!

538
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:40,617
Mike.

539
00:47:41,966 --> 00:47:44,884
Hey... wanna dance?

540
00:47:44,886 --> 00:47:46,969
No.

541
00:47:46,971 --> 00:47:52,516
We should, you know, get out
there, like, do our thing... Stop.

542
00:47:56,105 --> 00:47:58,147
I love this song.

543
00:47:58,149 --> 00:47:59,857
You?

544
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:04,737
Yeah, I love it. But not as
much as I love you, Lukey.

545
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:06,614
Get out of my room!

546
00:48:06,616 --> 00:48:08,866
Ow, ow. That hurts.

547
00:48:08,868 --> 00:48:10,785
It's gonna be worth it. Promise.

548
00:48:18,836 --> 00:48:21,337
See? Pretty.

549
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:25,633
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

550
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:27,259
Where did you see it last?

551
00:48:27,261 --> 00:48:28,596
Right here, where I put it.

552
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,222
What's in there that's
so important anyway?

553
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:33,017
You look fabulous, baby.

554
00:48:34,185 --> 00:48:35,726
Got it.

555
00:48:37,313 --> 00:48:40,191
That's your ride. Dusty!

556
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:48,366
Okay.

557
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:02,990
All right, buddy, here we are.

558
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:06,247
So, remember, once you get in there...

559
00:49:07,093 --> 00:49:08,175
Pretend like I don't care.

560
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:09,552
- You don't care.
- I don't care.

561
00:49:09,554 --> 00:49:11,889
There you go. You're learning,
my friend. You're learning.

562
00:49:13,558 --> 00:49:14,515
- Hey.
- What?

563
00:49:14,517 --> 00:49:18,227
Come on. You look great, okay?
You look... You look great.

564
00:49:18,229 --> 00:49:20,938
- Okay? Now you're gonna go in there...
- Yeah.

565
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,773
- Look like a million bucks.
- Yeah.

566
00:49:22,775 --> 00:49:24,150
And you're gonna slay 'em dead.

567
00:49:24,152 --> 00:49:25,735
Like a lion.

568
00:49:28,406 --> 00:49:29,864
Don't do that, okay?

569
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,034
Okay.

570
00:49:32,577 --> 00:49:33,786
Good luck.

571
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:50,803
- Looking very snazzy tonight, sir.
- Thank you, my lord.

572
00:50:33,638 --> 00:50:36,182
- Hey, Nance.
- Hey.

573
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,728
- What's in this?
- Pure fuel.

574
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:55,368
Holy shit. What happened to you?

575
00:50:56,201 --> 00:50:58,217
- What do you mean, "What happened"?
- What?

576
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,411
- Dude.
- Your hair.

577
00:50:59,413 --> 00:51:00,955
Is there a bird nesting in there?

578
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:02,623
What do you mean, "What's wrong"?

579
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:05,126
There's no bird nesting
in here, asshole. Okay?

580
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,293
I worked hard.

581
00:51:14,595 --> 00:51:15,749
Max...

582
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:17,890
Hey.

583
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:20,141
Um, it's nice, right?

584
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:21,897
You want to, um...

585
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:24,027
You want to, like... You know?

586
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,607
Like, just you and me?

587
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,859
Are you trying to ask
me to dance, stalker?

588
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:32,319
No, of course not.

589
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:34,405
Unless you want to.

590
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:36,577
So smooth. Come on.

591
00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:49,714
Hey, Zombie Boy.

592
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:51,463
Do you want to dance?

593
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:53,342
Um... I don't...

594
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:56,971
- I mean... I mean, yeah. Sure.
- Cool.

595
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:24,455
Wish me luck, Mike. I'm going in.

596
00:52:31,714 --> 00:52:34,215
- Stacy.
- He just broke up with Jennifer.

597
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:37,136
- Plus he's, like, not my type.
- Stacy.

598
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:40,990
Yeah?

599
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:44,685
Shall we?

600
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:48,481
Um, no, thanks.

601
00:53:01,661 --> 00:53:02,787
Oh, my God.

602
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:43,369
- Hey.
- Hey.

603
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,663
- Wanna dance?
- What?

604
00:53:47,665 --> 00:53:49,417
Come on. Let's go.

605
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,636
Here. Mmm-hmm.

606
00:54:01,887 --> 00:54:02,888
Closer.

607
00:54:04,598 --> 00:54:06,976
A little closer. Okay.

608
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:10,644
Now feel the music.

609
00:54:10,646 --> 00:54:12,354
The rhythm.

610
00:54:12,356 --> 00:54:15,149
Start to move to it.

611
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:17,026
Yeah. There.

612
00:54:17,028 --> 00:54:18,610
- Good?
- That's good. Yeah.

613
00:54:18,612 --> 00:54:19,778
Okay.

614
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:23,117
You know, out of all
of my brother's friends,

615
00:54:23,784 --> 00:54:24,785
you're my favorite.

616
00:54:26,162 --> 00:54:28,537
- You've always been my favorite.
- Really?

617
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:29,540
Yeah.

618
00:54:34,712 --> 00:54:37,838
Girls this age are dumb.

619
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,427
But give them a few
years, and they'll wise up.

620
00:54:42,303 --> 00:54:45,304
And, uh, you're gonna drive them nuts.

621
00:54:45,306 --> 00:54:48,684
- You think so?
- Oh, I know so.

622
00:55:03,115 --> 00:55:05,451
- Hey.
- Hey.

623
00:55:06,327 --> 00:55:08,329
Thought I might find you out here.

624
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:12,792
Will wanted me to give
him some space, so...

625
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:15,086
I'm giving him a few feet.

626
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:18,547
What do you say?

627
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:24,804
I'm pretty sure that Mr. Cooper
retired in the '70s, so...

628
00:55:26,263 --> 00:55:28,057
we might be okay.

629
00:55:44,281 --> 00:55:45,449
How are you holding up?

630
00:55:46,492 --> 00:55:48,617
- You know.
- Yeah.

631
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:50,287
That feeling never goes away.

632
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:53,999
It is true what they say, you know.

633
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:57,336
Every day it does get a little easier.

634
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:47,720
You look beautiful.

635
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:52,135
Do you wanna dance?

636
00:56:54,185 --> 00:56:56,769
I don't know how.

637
00:56:56,771 --> 00:56:58,353
I don't either.

638
00:56:58,355 --> 00:56:59,857
Do you want to figure it out?

639
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:10,949
Like this.

640
00:57:10,951 --> 00:57:12,745
Yeah, like that.
